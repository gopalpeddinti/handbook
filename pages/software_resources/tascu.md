TasCu (DBTL-U task curation), was developed as a web application to allow the IBISBA partners to contribute to a systematic definition of the *D*esign-*B*uild-*T*est-*L*earn-*U*pscale cycle of synthetic biology in terms of the steps (i.e., computational or wet-lab experimental tasks) constituting each phase of the biological engineering. The web application was available at https://tascu.vtt.fi and is currently phased out, and the output of the collaborative curation work facilitated by the TasCu is available via https://github.com/ibisba/tascu_data and the data was incorproated in IBISBAHub (https://hub.ibisba.eu/).
